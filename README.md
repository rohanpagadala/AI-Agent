# AI Research Agent ðŸ¤–

This is a simple AI research assistant using Gemini (Google Generative AI) and LangChain.  

It can search the web, get Wikipedia summaries, and save structured answers to a text file.  

The project uses tools like DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia API, and Pydantic for output parsing.  
To run, install dependencies and add your API key in a `.env` file.  
Then just run: `python3 main.py` and enter your research topic!
